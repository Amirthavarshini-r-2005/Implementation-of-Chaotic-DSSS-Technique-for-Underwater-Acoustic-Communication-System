# Implementation-of-Chaotic-DSSS-Technique-for-Underwater-Acoustic-Communication-System
Chaotic DSSS-based underwater acoustic communication using Logistic map for secure BPSK modulation, Doppler shift compensation (±10 m/s), and robust performance in noisy, dynamic channels. MATLAB simulations show improved stealth, efficiency, and eco-friendliness.
