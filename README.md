# Implementation-of-Chaotic-DSSS-Technique-for-Underwater-Acoustic-Communication-System
Chaotic DSSS-based underwater acoustic communication using Logistic map for secure BPSK modulation, Doppler shift compensation (¬±10‚ÄØm/s), and robust performance in noisy, dynamic channels. MATLAB simulations show improved stealth, efficiency, and eco-friendliness.
# Implementation of Chaotic DSSS for Underwater Acoustic Communication

This repository contains a MATLAB simulation of a **Chaotic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)** system tailored for **Underwater Acoustic Communication**. By replacing conventional pseudo-random (PN) sequences with **chaotic sequences**, we aim to enhance system performance and communication security in noisy underwater environments.
