# Implementation-of-Chaotic-DSSS-Technique-for-Underwater-Acoustic-Communication-System
Chaotic DSSS-based underwater acoustic communication using Logistic map for secure BPSK modulation, Doppler shift compensation (Â±10â€¯m/s), and robust performance in noisy, dynamic channels. MATLAB simulations show improved stealth, efficiency, and eco-friendliness.

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a *Chaotic Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)* system for *underwater acoustic communication. The system replaces traditional pseudo-random sequences with **chaotic sequences* to enhance signal security and randomness in low-bandwidth, noisy environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Implement a DSSS system using chaotic sequences generated by the logistic map.
- Model a basic underwater communication scenario using Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
- Simulate *security threats* like:
  - ðŸ“¡ *Jamming*: Intentional interference injected into the channel.
  - ðŸ•µ *Eavesdropping*: Unauthorized attempts to decode the transmitted message.
